# HolzMod HB Launcher
The main part of the HolzMod CFW. This is the module that allows you to load your homebrew apps.

## Installation
TODO

## Usage
Create a apps/ directory on your calculator and put the .hmb apps in there. 

**Important:** The files must be named app0.hmb, app1.hmb, app2.hmb, and so on. You must start with zero and continuously increment it or else your apps will not be detected.

## Building from source
You will need to have the CAS-SDK and its requirements installed to build the launcher. After that, just clone this repo and run make inside it.
```
git clone URL
cd "HolzMod HB Launcher"
make
```
